# Introduction

Welcome to the RISC Zero mdBook! This is very much an early stage work in progress. If you have somehow found your way to this book looking for documentation, we strongly encourage you to check out our other documentation and resources, including:
* our [main GitHub repo], including [links to our crates on docs.rs],
* our [website],
* our [Bonsai developer docs] (also a work in progress),
* our [YouTube channel], and
* our [Discord server].

Here is an example of code that will be tested:
```rust
assert_eq!(2+2, 4);
```
