# Bevy Game Engine Example

This code demonstrates a minimal example of how code from the bevy game engine can be used.

## Proving movement

This example takes as input an integer (call it `n`). When the program is run, a
world and a primary entity are created. After creation, the primary entity is
moved `n` units on the x-axis and writes the position in the journal. The host
can verify the receipt and also determine that the primary entity moved `n`
units. While this is a fairly minimal example, we encourage you to bring your
creativity to take this example to the next level!
